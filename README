qli_to_svg provides a simple conversion of QLI format files to SVG files. 
qli_to_svg also supports conversion to raster file formats supported by
the ImageMagic "convert" tool.

QLI files are the predominant format for the Statler Stitcher by GammillÂ®. 
The QLI format defines a collection of stitching paths. The file format is 
a subset of the Galil DMC language, although, no official information
from Gammill has been made available.

This is provided in an open source format in the hope that someone else may
find this useful.

Feel welcome to raise issues at:

I make no promise to look at them but I will, time permitting.  However raising
issues will likely get a response while emailing me directly will likely not.

To use qli_to_svg run the following command see some usages:
    qli_to_svg.py --help
    
You will need python 2.7 and the python packages "svg.path" installed on 
your computer.
